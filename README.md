Traffic Light Simulation
This project is a traffic light simulation developed using ASP.NET. It features a dynamic traffic light system with interactive elements, including car movement, pedestrian crossing, and visual representation of traffic lights. Users can manually control the traffic lights and simulate pedestrian crossings, making it a practical demonstration of traffic management concepts.

Features
Interactive Traffic Lights: Control the traffic lights manually (Red, Yellow, Green).
Car Movement: Observe car behavior based on traffic light changes.
Pedestrian Crossing: Simulate pedestrian crossings with visual feedback.
